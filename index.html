          <h2>Maze Runner</h2>
          <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/db/The_Maze_Runner_cover.png" alt="Maze" width="300" height="450"/>
          <p>The Maze Runner, my first book on the list. In the book, a select group of teenagers are put in this self-changing maze. On For a long time, the boys made it there home, not knowing too much of what resides in the maze, except vicious monsters. Eventually, a group of these boys would set out to discover a way out of this maze, called "Runners". The Runners would explore the maze each day, slowly maping it out, and figuring out how it works. The catch is, they have to solve this puzzle before the maze never closes its doors. All of those vicious monsters wont be behind anything anymore.<br>.............. <br>Ive found that this book has alot to offer as far as imagination is the topic. While reading the book, I saw how it istantly get the reader into to a position of "what happens next" and "what does it mean".It doesnt take long before that becomes a apart of the reraders personality. The Maze runner kinda leave its sugniture in the readers head. Where every event somehow relates to the curiosity sparked while reading the book.</p>
          <h2>Scorch Trails</h2>
          <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b6/The_Scorch_Trials_cover.jpg" alt="Scorch"/>
          <p>The Scorch Trails, part two of Maze Runner. This title puts the group of boys in  the second stage of "The Trails". This particular one is taken place in a literal scorch. A desterted city with soaring temperatures, and almost no water. In the Scorch, the boys are now faced with disease, killers, and deadly weather. They have to make it out of the Scorch within a certain amount of time, they be stuck there for ever with no cure to their sickness.<br>..............<br>The Scorch Trails contrasts The Maze Runner. It diviates from mystery to straight suspense. Its almost able to stop reading. Aside from just that, this book suports all that you'd expect and some more. From romances to tragedy. This might not be as relatable as other books, but I beleive thats what puts this book in its tier. </p>
          <h2>The Hunger Games</h2>
          <img src="http://mediaroom.scholastic.com/files/HungergamesCover.jpg" hight="370" width="245"alt="Games"/>
          <p>The Hunger Games takes place in a postwar society. The war was cause by the capitol mistreating its country divided in seperate districts. This paved way to a rebelion. To make sure it doesnt happen again the capitol created "The Hunger Games". A game where a girl and boy are slected from each district to fight for eachother for their lives, and is braodcasted across the entier country. This is a story of how a teenage girl fights to beat the odds in place of her little sister.<br>............<br>I personally would put this book in my to 5. Most others would do so by insinct. I think what makes this book so amazing is how the conflict includes a teenager fighting for her life. A TEENAGER! Not a man or woman. This concept kinda activates something with the reader. Like the question, "Why would anyone do this!" While still making you want to read it because of how cra- original this is. This is a book you definately cant forget about.</p>
          <h2>Catching Fire</h2>
