          <h2>Maze Runner</h2>
          <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/db/The_Maze_Runner_cover.png" alt="Maze" width="300" height="450"/>
          <p>The Maze Runner, my first book on the list. In the book, a select group of teenagers are put in this self-changing maze. On For a long time, the boys made it there home, not knowing too much of what resides in the maze, except vicious monsters. Eventually, a group of these boys would set out to discover a way out of this maze, called "Runners". The Runners would explore the maze each day, slowly maping it out, and figuring out how it works. The catch is, they have to solve this puzzle before the maze never closes its doors. All of those vicious monsters wont be behind anything anymore.<br>.............. <br>Ive found that this book has alot to offer as far as imagination is the topic. While reading the book, I saw how it istantly get the reader into to a position of "what happens next" and "what does it mean".It doesnt take long before that becomes a apart of the reraders personality. The Maze runner kinda leave its sugniture in the readers head. Where every event somehow relates to the curiosity sparked while reading the book.</p>
          <h2>Scorch Trails</h2>
          <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b6/The_Scorch_Trials_cover.jpg" alt="Scorch"/>
          <p>The Scorch Trails, part two of Maze Runner. This title puts the group of boys in  the second stage of "The Trails". This particular one is taken place in a literal scorch. A desterted city with soaring temperatures, and almost no water. In the Scorch, the boys are now faced with disease, killers, and deadly weather. They have to make it out of the Scorch within a certain amount of time, they be stuck there for ever with no cure to their sickness.<br>..............<br>The Scorch Trails contrasts The Maze Runner. It diviates from mystery to straight suspense. Its almost able to stop reading. Aside from just that, this book suports all that you'd expect and some more. From romances to tragedy. This might not be as relatable as other books, but I beleive thats what puts this book in its tier. </p>
          <h2>The Hunger Games</h2>
          <img src="http://mediaroom.scholastic.com/files/HungergamesCover.jpg" hight="370" width="245"alt="Games"/>
          <p>The Hunger Games takes place in a postwar society. The war was cause by the capitol mistreating its country divided in seperate districts. This paved way to a rebelion. To make sure it doesnt happen again the capitol created "The Hunger Games". A game where a girl and boy are slected from each district to fight for eachother for their lives, and is braodcasted across the entier country. This is a story of how a teenage girl fights to beat the odds in place of her little sister.<br>............<br>I personally would put this book in my to 5. Most others would do so by insinct. I think what makes this book so amazing is how the conflict includes a teenager fighting for her life. A TEENAGER! Not a man or woman. This concept kinda activates something with the reader. Like the question, "Why would anyone do this!" While still making you want to read it because of how original this is. This is a book you definately cant forget about.</p>
          <h2>Catching Fire</h2>
          <img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AS9k91vUIpQ/UoGc6OjBXEI/AAAAAAAACVc/x5muRBtVyr4/s1600/catchingfirebook680.jpg" hight="370" width="245" alt="Catching"/>
          <p>This is the second part of the Hunger Games. In this instalment, Katniss enjoys the spoils of winning the Hunger Games... Along, with Peeta. They live like royales and eventually want to start a revolution. During all of this, Katniss and Peeta start to grow feelings for eachother in the background of all of the comotion. They are exsposed to the capitals extream acts of brutality, including the exicution of the residnce in dirtirct 11. Those of whitch who salute to her. She then finds out that the capitol want to kill her before the start of the next Hunger Games so she wont be able to symbolize the revolution to come, in hopes of preventing it from happening.<br> Out of all of the books on this page, this ine would be the most powerful. I feel as if the language in this book is the same as the rest, but theres something about it that compliments the enitirety of the story. While reading the book, you'll find out what a distopiant world is really like.<br>............<br>In the second part of the Hunger Games Series, I really feel like I've gotten to know more about the characters. Not actually, but I feel more comfortable with the caracters. Katniss almost seems like someon ethat you would've known for years now, even though she only exists inside of the book. It weird. I'd like to think it's because of her archetype. Shes the heroe of the stary, and well everyone is familiar with heroes with heroes in many ways. She's kinda like another Batman to me. Peeta would be Robin.</p>
          <h2>The Death Cure</h2>
          <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/55/The_Death_Cure.jpg" height="370" width="245" alt="Deathcure"/>
          <p>The Death Cure is the third and final part of the Maze Runner series, Tomas and his freinds are done with all of the test. There so close to finding out the cure to the Flare, and find out some disturbing news in the middle of it. Some of Tomas' freinds decided to get their memories back, but Tomas doesnt. He doest trust WICKED enough to let them inside of his head. So he and a couple of others decide to escape. They ended up landing in this city where all of their other freinds had landed. They meet some familiar faces too. After joining forces again, the meet an orginazation called "The Right Arm," who are also against WICKED. And so after days and days of fighting and worrying about who to trust, it all finally pays off. It turns out that everything was apart of the plan. WICKED is completey done with all the test and now have the cure for the Flare, and end up saving the human race, dispite all of the horrible things they had to do to get there.<br>.............<br>Im finnaly done with the story of the Maze Runner! Each book specifically were all simillar, but each one had a certaintone to it. I'd describe the Death Cure as having an "All or Nothing," kinda of feel. As things get closer to the wire, your wits start tl spiral out of control. Tomas coudn't trust anyone, and beleived that all of the information that was being fed to him was false. Half of the grup are imune to the disease, so they have no choice but to their freinds slowly die on the inside. It's a pretty intersting plot. One of the only ones to get my attention.</p>
